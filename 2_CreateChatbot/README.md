## Step 2: Configure Cognito pool id in Lambda function

```
import json
import boto3

client = boto3.client('cognito-idp')

with open('./response.json', 'r') as r:
    response = json.load(r)
    response_success = response['response_success']
    response_fail = response['response_fail']

#use your cognito user pool ID
PoolID = 'xxxxxxx'
```

## Step 3: Creating your Bot
